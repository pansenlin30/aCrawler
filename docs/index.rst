üîç A simple web-crawling framework, based on aiohttp.

This project is at *very early* stage and may face breaking changes in the future.

Feature
-------


* Write your crawler in one Python script with asyncio
* Schedule task with priority, fingerprint, exetime, recrawl...
* Middleware: add handlers before or after tasks
* Simple shortcuts to speed up scripting
* Parse html conveniently with Parsel
* Stop and Resume: crawl periodically and persistently
* Distributed work support with Redis

Installation
------------

To install, simply use `pipenv <http://pipenv.org/>`_ (or pip):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pipenv install acrawler

   (Optional)
   $ pipenv install uvloop      #(only Linux/macOS, for faster asyncio event loop)
   $ pipenv install aioredis    #(if you need Redis support)
   $ pipenv install motor       #(if you need MongoDB support)
